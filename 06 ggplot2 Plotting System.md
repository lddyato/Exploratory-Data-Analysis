* A	data	frame	
* aesthe/c mappings:	how	data	are	mapped	to	color,	size		
* geoms:	geometric	objects	like	points,	lines,	shapes.		
* facets:	for	condi:onal	plots.		
* stats:	sta:s:cal	transforma:ons	like	binning,	quan:les,	smoothing.		
* scales:	what	scale	an	aesthe:c	map	uses	(example:	male	=	red,	female	=	blue).
