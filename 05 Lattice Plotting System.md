# Lattice plotting system
The lattice plotting system is implementd using the following packages 
* **`lattice`**: contains code for producing Trellis graphics, which are independent of the ‘base’ graphics system; 
including functions like **`xyplot, bwplot, levelplot`**
* **`grid`**: implements a different graphing system independent of the ‘base’ system; 
the lattice package builds on top of grid; 
 + we seldom call functions from grid package directly.
* The lattice plotting system does not have a "two-phase" aspect with separate plotting and annotation like in base plotting
* All plotting/annotation is done at once with a single function call

## Lattice Fuction
* **`xyplot`**: main fuction for creating scatterplots
```r
xyplot(y ~ x |f * g, data)# f and g could be categorical variables 
If no data frame or list is passed, then the parent frame is used.
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality, pch=8, col = "red", main = "Big Apple Data")
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | as.factor(Month), data=airquality, layout=c(5,1))

```
* **`bwplot`**: box and whiskers plots (boxplots)
* **`histogram`**
* **`stripplot`**: like a boxplot but with actual points
* **`dotplot`**:plot dots on "violin strings"
* **`splom`**: scatterplot matrix; like pairs in base plotting system
* **`levelplot, contourplot`**: plotting "image" data

##Aimple lattice plot
```r
library(lattics)
library(datasets)
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality)
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | Month, data = airquality, layout = c(5,1)) # 5 columns and 1 row
```

## Lattice behavior
Lattice functions behave differently from base graphics functions in one critical way.
* Base graphics functions plot data directly to the graphics device (screen, PDF file, etc.)
* Lattice graphics functions return an object of class trellis
* The print methods for lattice functions actually do the work of plotting the data on the graphics
device.
* Lattice functions return "plot objects" that can, in principle, be stored (but it’s usually better to just
save the code + data).
* On the command line, trellis objects are auto-printed so that it appears the function is plotting the
data
```r
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality) #Nothing happens
print(p) # plot appears
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality) #suto-printing
```
## Lattice Panel Functions
* Lattice functions have a panel function which controls what happens inside each panel of the
plot.
* The lattice package comes with default panel functions, but you can supply your own if you want
to customize what happens in each panel
* Panel functions receive the x/y coordinates of the data points in their panel (along with any
optional arguments)

```r
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
f <- rep(0:1, each = 50)
y <- x + f - f * x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
f <- factor(f, labels = c("Group 1", "Group 2"))
xyplot(y ~ x | f, layout = c(2, 1)) ## Plot with 2 panels
## Custom panel function
xyplot(y ~ x | f, panel = function(x, y, ...) {
panel.xyplot(x, y, ...) ## First call the default panel function for 'xyplot'
panel.abline(h = median(y), lty = 2) ## Add a horizontal line at the median
panel.lmline(x, y, col = 2) ## Overlay a simple linear regression line
})
xyplot(price ~ carat | color*cut, data=diamonds, strip=FALSE, pch=20, xlab="Carat", ylab="Price", main="Diamonds are Sparkly!")
source(pathtofile("plot1.R"), local=TRUE)
```


## Many Panel Lattice Plot: Example from MAACS   

* Study: Mouse Allergen and Asthma Cohort Study (MAACS)
* Study subjects: Children with asthma living in Baltimore City, many allergic to mouse allergen
* Design: Observational study, baseline home visit + every 3 months for a year.
* Question: How does indoor airborne mouse allergen vary over time and across subjects?

## Summary

* Lattice plots are constructed with a single function call to a core lattice function (e.g. xyplot)
* Aspects like margins and spacing are automatically handled and defaults are usually sufficient
* The lattice system is ideal for creating conditioning plots where you examine the same kind of
plot under many different conditions
* Panel functions can be specified/customized to modify what is plotted in each of the plot panels
