#Principles of analysis graphics

**Principle 1: Show corparisons**   
 + Evidence for a pyhothesis is always relative to another competing yhpothesis.  
 + Always ask “Compared to What?”

**Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure**  

 + What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

**Principle 3: Show multivariate data** 

 + multivariate = more than 2 variables
 + the real world is multivariate
 + need to ‘escape flatland’
 
**Principle 4: Integration of evidence** 
 + completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
 + data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation.
 + don’t let the tool drive the analysis.  
 
**Principle 5: Describle and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, scources, et al.** 
 + a data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible.
 
**Principle 6: Content is king**
 + analytical presentations ultimately stand or falling depend on the quanlity, relerance, and integrity of their content.
